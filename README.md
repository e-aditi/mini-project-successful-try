# Abstract:
Information is the new currency. The high exchange of information in various forms has brought new challenges in protecting data. Attackers are trying to get access to secret information and this is also part of a violation of privacy. There are many techniques to hide secret information in data. To protect confidential data, reversible data hiding techniques that are histogram-based are mostly used. The histogram bit shifting method is a technique that is used to achieve reversible data hiding in images. A watermark is embedded in the image in a secured manner. The work in this project is based on using this technique for video communication. High-quality image frames are identified from the video and are used for data hiding. The quality of the frame is defined by some parameters and there is a quality threshold for the selection of frames. This threshold value is measured using the firefly optimization algorithm. The aim is to achieve high security and video quality compared to other reversible data hiding techniques.

# Learnings:
- Visual cryptography
- Swarm intelligence based optimization techniques
- Local and global optimal values
- Image embedding techniques

# Challenges faced:
- The output image won't be the original image(as two shares are overlapped) while performing visual cryptography.
- Calculating the capacity of the image to embebed and resizing the watermark accordingly.
- Understanding the objective function
- Exploring the solution set through exploration parameter.
- Tuning the parameters for the algorithm.
